# The aim of this is to provide roughly (i.e. to the degree required by this
# project) the same environment as that provided by Travis when given this
# project's .travis.yml file.
# Intended to be used as a provisioning playbook in Vagrant.
#
# TODO: most of this could be replaced by two roles from Galaxy which install
# Docker and Ansible 2.6+, I guess...
